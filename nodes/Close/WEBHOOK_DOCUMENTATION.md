# Close CRM Webhook Trigger Documentation

## Overview

The Close CRM Webhook Trigger node allows n8n workflows to execute automatically when events occur in your Close CRM account. This provides real-time integration with Close CRM, eliminating the need for polling-based triggers.

## Features

- **Real-time event processing**: Workflows trigger instantly when events occur in Close CRM
- **Comprehensive event coverage**: Support for 12 event categories with 60+ specific event types
- **Secure webhook verification**: HMAC-SHA256 signature validation to prevent unauthorized requests
- **Automatic lifecycle management**: Webhooks are automatically registered on activation and cleaned up on deactivation
- **Flexible action selection**: Choose specific actions within each event category

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Close CRM account with API access
- Close CRM API key (available in Settings → API Keys)
- Configured Close API credentials in n8n

### Basic Configuration

1. Add the "Close Webhook" node to your workflow
2. Select your Close API credentials
3. Choose a **Trigger On** category (e.g., Lead, Contact, Opportunity)
4. Select one or more **Actions** for that category
5. Activate the workflow

The node will automatically:

- Register a webhook with Close CRM
- Store the webhook ID and signature key
- Begin receiving events immediately

## Event Categories

### 1. Lead

Monitor changes to lead records in your CRM.

**Available Actions:**

- **Lead Created**: Triggered when a new lead is created
- **Lead Updated**: Triggered when a lead is modified
- **Lead Deleted**: Triggered when a lead is deleted
- **Lead in New Status**: Triggered when a lead moves to a different status

**API Mapping:**

## Security

### Webhook Signature Verification

Every webhook request from Close CRM includes cryptographic signatures to verify authenticity:

**Headers:**

- `close-sig-timestamp`: Unix timestamp when the request was sent
- `close-sig-hash`: HMAC-SHA256 hash of the payload

**Verification Process:**

1. Extract timestamp and hash from headers
2. Compute expected hash: `HMAC-SHA256(signature_key, timestamp + body)`
3. Compare received hash with expected hash using constant-time comparison
4. Reject requests with invalid signatures

**Security Features:**

- Constant-time comparison prevents timing attacks
- Signature key is securely stored in workflow state
- Automatic rejection of unsigned or improperly signed requests

### Best Practices

1. **Keep workflows active**: Deactivated workflows will have their webhooks automatically deleted
2. **Monitor failed events**: Check workflow execution history for signature verification failures
3. **Secure your n8n instance**: Use HTTPS endpoints for webhook URLs
4. **API key security**: Protect your Close API credentials with appropriate n8n access controls

## Webhook Lifecycle

### Activation (Node Enabled)

When you activate a workflow with the Close Webhook trigger:

1. **Get webhook URL**: n8n provides a unique webhook endpoint URL
2. **Build events array**: Selected actions are mapped to Close API event format
3. **Register webhook**: POST request to `https://api.close.com/api/v1/webhook/`
   ```json
   {
   	"url": "https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/...",
   	"events": [
   		{ "object_type": "lead", "action": "created" },
   		{ "object_type": "lead", "action": "updated" }
   	]
   }
   ```
4. **Store credentials**: Save `webhook_id` and `signature_key` in workflow state
5. **Ready**: Webhook is active and will receive events

### Event Reception

When an event occurs in Close CRM:

1. **Event triggered**: Close sends POST request to your webhook URL
2. **Headers included**: `close-sig-timestamp` and `close-sig-hash`
3. **Signature verification**: Node validates the request authenticity
4. **Workflow execution**: Valid events trigger the workflow

### Deactivation (Node Disabled)

When you deactivate a workflow:

1. **Retrieve webhook ID**: Get stored webhook_id from workflow state
2. **Delete webhook**: DELETE request to `https://api.close.com/api/v1/webhook/{webhook_id}`
3. **Clean up state**: Remove webhook_id and signature_key from workflow state
4. **Complete**: Webhook unregistered, no more events received

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Triggering

**Problem**: Workflow doesn't execute when events occur in Close CRM

**Solutions:**

1. Verify workflow is activated (green indicator)
2. Check that the webhook exists: Go to Close CRM → Settings → API → Webhooks
3. Review workflow execution history for errors
4. Test with a simple event (e.g., create a test lead)

### Signature Verification Failed

**Problem**: Events are rejected with "Webhook signature verification failed"

**Solutions:**

1. Ensure your n8n instance URL is accessible from the internet
2. Check that the workflow hasn't been deactivated and reactivated (recreates signature key)
3. Verify no proxy or middleware is modifying webhook requests
4. Check system time on your n8n server is accurate

### Multiple Events Received

**Problem**: Workflow executes multiple times for a single action

**Solutions:**

1. This is expected behavior for Close CRM (they may retry failed webhooks)
2. Implement idempotency in your workflow using the `event.id` field
3. Use n8n's built-in deduplication features if available

### Custom Activity Draft Edits Don't Trigger

**Problem**: Custom activity edits in draft mode do not trigger the workflow

**Explanation:**

1. This trigger intentionally ignores draft autosave and draft edit updates
2. For custom activities, workflow execution happens on submit (`draft -> published`) only
3. The full activity payload is available when the submit event is emitted

### Webhook Registration Failed

**Problem**: Error when activating workflow: "Failed to create webhook"

**Solutions:**

1. Verify Close API credentials are valid and have webhook permissions
2. Check Close CRM webhook limit (organizations have a maximum number of webhooks)
3. Ensure your n8n instance is reachable from the internet (Close must be able to POST to it)
4. Review error details in n8n's workflow logs
