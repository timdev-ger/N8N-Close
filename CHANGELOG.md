# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **User attribution** (`user_id`) field on Lead create/update, Contact create/update, Note create/update, Call create/update, Email create/update, SMS create/update, and Custom Activity create/update — lets you post activities on behalf of a specific team member (closes #19).
- **Date Created** (`date_created`) override on Note create, Custom Activity create, Call create, Email create, and SMS create — allows back-dating activities to the exact time an event occurred (closes #20).
- **Missing contact type options** — email type now includes `Direct`, `Mobile`, `Home`, `Fax`, and `URL`; phone type now includes `Direct` and `URL`, matching all types available in Close CRM (closes #17).
- **Add / Remove action for multi-value custom fields** — Choice (Multiple), User (Multiple), and Contact (Multiple) custom fields now expose an **Action** selector (Replace / Add / Remove, default: Replace). Selecting Add or Remove appends `.add` / `.remove` to the API key (e.g. `custom.cf_xxx.add`), enabling single-value mutations without a prior Get (closes #18).

### Changed
- Replaced `ts-jest` with `@swc/jest` for test compilation — compatible with Jest 30.4.x and significantly faster.

### Technical
- Bumped all dev dependencies to latest: `@types/node` ^25.9.1, `eslint` ^10.4.1, `typescript` ^6.0.3, `jest` ^30.4.2, `@swc/core` ^1.15.40, `@swc/jest` ^0.2.39, `pnpm` 11.5.1, `@portabletext/to-html` ^5.0.2.
- Added `types: ['jest', 'node']` to jest transform config for TypeScript 6 compatibility.
- All 194 tests green across 4 suites.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- New "Automation & Bulk Actions" resources on the Close CRM node:
  - **Sequence**: list, get, create, update, delete sequences; subscribe a contact, get / update / list sequence subscriptions (e.g. pause/resume).
  - **Bulk Action**: create / list / get for bulk Email, bulk Edit (set lead status, set/clear custom field), bulk Delete, and bulk Sequence Subscription (subscribe / pause / resume / resume_finished).
  - **Export**: start lead exports, start opportunity exports, list exports, fetch a single export to poll `status` and retrieve `download_url`.
  - **Field Enrichment**: AI-enrich a custom field on a lead or contact via `POST /enrich_field/`.
- JSON-typed inputs for `s_query`, `schedule`, `steps`, `params`, and `sort` so the full Close advanced filtering / scheduling capability is reachable from n8n.
- Safety check: bulk delete now requires an `s_query` to avoid accidentally targeting all leads.

### Technical
- Added `parseJsonParam` helper to validate JSON inputs with clear error messages.
- 28 new unit tests covering the new endpoints and edge cases (pause/subscribe action types, missing required fields, invalid JSON, list pagination); test count is now 194 across 4 suites.
- All checks green: `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, `jest`, `npm run build`.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- Close Trigger activation no longer wedges with `Duplicate active subscription` after Docker container or n8n server restarts; webhooks on Close are cleaned up automatically and the webhook is recreated on retry.
- Close Trigger deactivation now always clears local webhook state, even if Close rejects the `DELETE` call, so the next activation starts from a clean slate.

### Technical
- Hardened the webhook lifecycle so lost local state, manually deleted webhooks on Close, or `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` changes recover automatically on the next activation cycle.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- **#14**: Close CRM webhooks now compare the stored webhook URL with the current n8n webhook URL before reuse, recreate automatically on mismatch, and reactivate paused webhooks in place.

### Technical
- Preserved webhook ID and signature key when reactivating paused webhooks via `PUT`.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **#12**: Close CRM now discards `null`/`undefined` values from lead and contact create/update payloads before sending requests.
- Prevented API validation errors when optional contact fields such as email or phone are intentionally left blank.
- Applied the same nullish cleanup to related contact/address bodies to keep payload handling consistent.

### Changed
- Extended request-body sanitization across the Close node's lead and contact create/update flows.
- Added regression coverage for null contact fields in the test suite.

### Technical
- Introduced a small internal helper to strip nullish values from request payloads.
- Verified the Close node test suite after the payload cleanup changes.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **#7**: Fixed an edge-case failure in workflow execution that could cause unstable behavior with specific Close CRM payloads.
- **#8**: Resolved a follow-up regression that led to inconsistent results in certain node operation scenarios.

### Changed
- Improved operation flow to provide more predictable execution across varying real-world payload structures.
- Applied backward-compatible reliability improvements for node behavior and run consistency.

### Technical
- Added explicit issue traceability for this release (`#7`, `#8`).
- Completed minor internal maintenance and release housekeeping for npm publication (`1.6.0`).
